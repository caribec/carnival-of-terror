# Killer Clown 2D Game Art
Hand-drawn sprites and Unity implementation for a 2D action platformer.

## Overview
This project contains my custom 2D game art and Unity scenes for a side-scrolling platformer created during Spring 2025.
I designed and animated the main character (MC) and enemy characters (EC), built environments, and implemented them in Unity.
